This tutorial works for Dell 10th, 12th, 13th and 14th Gen PowerEdge servers running iDRAC prior to v3.34.34.34, and most HPE ProLiant servers.

‚ù∑ Install IPMI Tool to C:\ipmitool
‚ù∏ Log into iDRAC web interface and under Network enable IPMI.
‚ùπ In Win search bar type "cmd" and right click Command Prompt and 'Run as Administrator'.
‚ù∫ Type: cd\
‚ùª Type: cd ipmitool
‚ùº You're now ready to start giving commands...

(I recommend opening up Notepad to type out the commands for simple copy/paste into IPMI Command Prompt. Go ahead and copy all of the commands here so you can just copy from a list.)

Replace 'ipaddress' with the IP address of your Dell iDRAC or HPE iLO. Replace 'username' and 'password' with your iDRAC or iLO login credentials. It's convenient to have the iDRAC or iLO web interface displaying the fan speeds to verify its actions as you submit the commands. The low refresh rate makes the reported speeds have a slight delay.

Executed from Command Prompt=

‚úÖ Enable Manual Fan Control=   
ipmitool -I lanplus -H ipaddress -U username -P password raw 0x30 0x30 0x01 0x00

‚úÖ Disable Manual Fan Control=    
ipmitool ... raw 0x30 0x30 0x01 0x01

‚úÖ 3rd Party PCIe Response State (Fast  fan speed when no therm sensors on PCIe card)=    
ipmitool ... raw 0x30 0xce 0x01 0x16 0x05 0x00 0x00 0x00 
                    Result1= ... 00 00 00 (Enabled)
                    Result2= ... 01 00 00 (Disabled)

‚úÖ Enable 3rd Party PCIe Response=   
ipmitool ... raw 0x30 0xce 0x00 0x16 0x05 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x05 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00  

‚úÖ Disable 3rd Party PCIe Response=    
ipmitool ... raw 0x30 0xce 0x00 0x16 0x05 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x05 0x00 0x01 0x00 0x00

‚úÖ Set All Fans (0xff) to % (??) Speed (in Hexadecimal)=   
ipmitool ... raw 0x30 0x30 0x02 0xff 0x??

‚úÖ Set All Fans (0xff) to 50% (0x32)=
ipmitool ... raw 0x30 0x30 0x02 0xff 0x32

üö©System fan #'s vary per chassis. Fan1 starts on the left side behind the Dell logo and can go up to 7 fans to the right side behind the Intel badge. The IPMI fan numbers are NOT the same as the Fan# labels on the chassis. Fan1=0x00, Fan2=0x01, Fan3=0x02, Fan4=0x03, Fan5=0x04, ect.üö©

‚úÖ Set Fan1 (0x00) to 30%  (0x1E)=                   
ipmitool ... raw 0x30 0x30 0x02 0x00 0x1E

‚úÖ Set Fan2 (0x01) to 30% (0x1E)=
ipmitool ... raw 0x30 0x30 0x02 0x01 0x1E

‚úÖ Set Fan3 (0x02) to 30% (0x1E)
ipmitool ... raw 0x30 0x30 0x02 0x02 0x1E
